=== What is a scab?

After God had finished the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire, he had some awful substance left with which to make a cab. A scab is a two-legged animal with a cork-screw soul, a watterlogged barain and a combination backbone made of jelly and glue. Where others have hears, the scab carries a tumor of rotten principles!


=== There is power ain a union
There is power in a fact'ry, power in the land, power in the hands of the worker; but it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand: there is power in a union!
...
Money speaks for money, the devil for his own,; who comes to speak for the skin and the bone? What a comfort to the widow, a light to the child, there is power in a union

===== Solidarity forever!
In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold; therater than the might of armies, magnified a thousand-fold. We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old, for the union makes us strong

===== With Spring, Jose Marti
With the Spring
the song comes
the sweet sadness
and the gallant love

with the Spring
an anxiety comes
of a prisoner bird
who wants to fly

there is no nobler scepter
than to suffer:
only one king exists:
the dead man is the king

===== Guantanamera, Jose Marti
My verse is clear green
And burning red
My verse is clear green
and burning red
My verse is a wounded deer
that seeks refuge in the mountain

====== Jose Marti, Because Your Eyes Were Two Flames (Verse XIX)
Because your eyes were two flames
And your brooch wasn't pinned right,
I thought you had spent the night
In playing forbidden games.

Because you were vile and devious
Such deadly hatred I bore you:
To see you was to abhor you
So lovely and yet so villainous.

Because a note came to light,
I know now where you had been,
And what you had done unseen â€”
Cried for me all the long night.
